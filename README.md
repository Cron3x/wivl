# Idea:
    create Language that is a combination of Zig and Rust but with a garbage collector.
    I use this project to learn how to implement my own language and usefull librarys for it.

    _Wivl_ contains the standart library (std) 
    than there will be _zaphyr_, which is a homage to ruby on rails, so its like a server framwork like axum
    and _iqnis_ which is going to be a way to use async and greenthreads.
